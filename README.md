### Summary  
The idea for this loading screen was to allow players to choose how it looks for them. This means from the colors being used to the entire layout. They can even choose to play music or have it disabled by simply setting the volume to 0. There is support for multiple layouts which allows you to either let the players decide or allow you to have a multi-server loading screen. On top of that you can create content that appears for specific gamemodes. This includes gamemode specific backgrounds, messages, and rules.
